                                layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of
                                devices, such as large screens, lgall screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML
                                and can be used with any XML-based markup language.

                                A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically
                                stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a
                                database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the
                                applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often
                                shortened to just database.
                                Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled
                                in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying
                                efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled,
                                and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and
                                querying data.

                                Databases have evolved dramatically since their inception in the early 1960s.
                                Navigational databases such as the hierarchical database (which relied on a tree-like
                                model and allowed only a one-to-many relationship), and the network database (a more
                                flexible model that allowed multiple relationships), were the original systems used to
                                store and manipulate data. Although simple, these early systems were inflexible. In the
                                1980s, relational databases became popular, followed by object-oriented databases in the
                                1990s. More recently, NoSQL databases came about as a response to the growth of the
                                internet and the need for faster speed and processing of unstructured data. Today, cloud
                                databases and self-driving databases are breaking new ground when it comes to how data
                                is collected, stored, managed, and utilized.

                                SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query,
                                manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. SQL was first developed at
                                IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the
                                SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM, Oracle,
                                and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new programming languages are
                                beginning to appear.

                        <strong>Coding is a process by which we tell computers what to do—how a program should work, how
                            a website should run, etc.</strong> Coders use programming languages in order to communicate
                        these instructions. Nowadays, programming and coding are mostly used interchangeably.

                        <strong>No.</strong> It’s easy to think that with its base in 1s and 0s, coding is all about
                        math. And not just any math, but complex calculations—the stuff some of us never learned.
                        Don’t let a lack of natural math aptitude scare you away from coding. The truth is that
                        extraordinary math skills and coding do not necessarily go hand-in-hand.
